            <h3>The Advanced AI Course @ KAUST Academy</h3>
            <p>
                In my <a href="KAUST_Acad_intro.html" target="_blank">previous blog post</a>, I wrote about my experience attending the Intro to AI course at <a href="https://academy.kaust.edu.sa/Home" target="_blank">KAUST Academy</a>. The course was a great introduction to the field of AI, and I learned a lot about the basics of machine learning and deep learning.
                On the last day of the introductory course, we took some assessments that qualified some of us to the advanced course. I was one of the qualified students!
                The advanced course was also held in different locations, and I attended the one at KAUST. Our instructor was Prof. Naeemullah Khan.
            </p>
            <p>
                The course began with a review of the basics of AI. We then delved into the latest techniques in deep learning, such as CNNs, data loaders, autoencoders, and variational autoencoders.
                The teaching methods used in the course were similar to those used in the Intro to AI course. We used a combination of lectures, and hands-on exercises. This allowed us to learn the material in a deep and meaningful way.
            </p>


            <p>
                After three days of lectures, the fourth day of the course was dedicated to assessments. We were given ML, and coding assessments.
                Students who passed with distinction in the assessments were qualified to attend the AI summer program at KAUST.
            </p>
            <p>I passed the assessments with distinction, and I'm thrilled to be attending the AI summer program at KAUST this summer!</p>
            <p>Thanks to the KAUST Academy team for their efforts and organization in making this opportunity possible. I'm so glad that they took a chance on me. I'm sure that I will learn a lot at the AI summer program, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.</p>
