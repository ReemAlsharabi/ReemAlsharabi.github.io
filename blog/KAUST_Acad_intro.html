            <h3>Intro to AI @ KAUST Academy</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://academy.kaust.edu.sa/Home" target="_blank">KAUST Academy</a> is an initiative at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) that is dedicated to providing world-class blended learning experiences.
                The Academy is committed to preparing students and professionals for success in the 21st century workforce with high-quality education taught by experienced faculty and industry experts.
            </p>
            <p>
                In March 2023, I had the opportunity to attend the KAUST Academy Intro to AI course, which was held in different locations in Saudi Arabia and taught by professors from KAUST.
                I was lucky enough to attend the course at KAUST, where we were taught by Prof. George Turkiyyah and Prof.Rita A. Ferreira. The course focused on supervised learning, covering classical ML and an introduction to DL.
                The teaching methods used in the course were very innovative, and they made the material easy to understand and apply.
            </p>


            <p>
                After four days of lectures, the fifth day of the course was dedicated to assessments. We were given math, ML, and coding assessments.
                Students who passed with distinction in the assessments were qualified to attend the advanced AI course.
            </p>
            <p>I passed the assessments with distinction, and I am excited to be attending the advanced AI course!</p>
            <p>Thanks to the KAUST Academy team for their efforts and organization in making this opportunity possible.</p>
