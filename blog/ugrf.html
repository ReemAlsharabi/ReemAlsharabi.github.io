            <h3>Effat Undergraduate Research Forum Experience</h3>
            <p>I had the privilege to participate in the 4th Undergraduate Research Forum (UGRF) at Effat University, held on Thursday, May 11th, 2023. The forum, featuring 30 paper participants, and posters across four tracks, centered around the theme of "Elevating Societies Through Transformations", providing a platform for undergraduate students, including myself, to present their research.</p>

            <p>During this event, I presented our paper titled "A Comparative Analysis of the Defense Methods Against Adversarial Attacks in Deep Learning Models", which was a part of my senior project proposal.</p>
            <p>In a concise 3-minute presentation, I aimed to effectively convey the issue of adversarial attacks in deep learning models, highlight existing defense methods, and identify gaps in current techniques.</p>

            <p>Participating in the forum was a great opportunity to share my research with other undergraduate students and faculty members. I was also able to learn about the research being done by other students in a variety of fields.</p>
            <p>To my delight, I received the second-place honor in my track, a remarkable achievement that I attribute to the unwavering support of my co-authors.</p>

            <h5>Lessons Learned</h5>

            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring clarity: It is crucial to ensure that the audience understands the problem you are trying to solve. This involves clearly and concisely explaining the problem, its importance, and how your research is relevant.</li>
                <li>Presenting results: Allocating sufficient time to present research findings and outcomes greatly enhances the impact of the presentation. It is important to showcase the results and their implications effectively.</li>
                <li>Re-present: Be prepared to explain your research in more detail if needed. The judges and audience members may have additional questions about your methods, findings, and implications. It's important to address these questions and provide further insights and clarification. Sometimes, there may be instances where questions arise about topics already covered in the presentation. In such cases, take a deep breath (silently) and explain them again, using a different approach. It's possible that the listener wasn't paying attention or they just didn't get it the first time, we (students) do this all the time ;)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I want to extend a big thank you to the organizers of the UGRF for providing this valuable opportunity.</p>
